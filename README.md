# Labs of Blockchain and applications course
## 1. Lab 1: Simplified Blockchain implementation
The main objective of this lab assignment is to build a simplified blockchain. A blockchain is basically a distributed database of records. What makes it unique is that it uses cryptographic hash functions to create a tamper-proof mechanism of committed transactions through distributed consensus.  Most blockchains are permissionless, which means that they allow public membership of
nodes, often implemented on top of a peer-to-peer network, allowing a public distributed database, i.e. everyone who uses the database has a full or partial copy of it. A new record can be added only after the consensus between the other keepers of the database. Also, itâ€™s blockchain that made crypto-currencies and smart contracts possible.
This lab consists of three parts. Each part will be explained in more detail in their own sections.
1. **The chain of blocks**: Implement a chain of blocks as an ordered, back-linked list data
structure.
2. **Efficient transactions and blocks verification**: Implement an efficient way to verify membership of certain transactions in a block using Merkle Trees.
3. **Command line client and benchmarks**

## 2. Lab 2: Bitcoin scripting language 
The objective of this lab assignment is to gain a deeper understanding of Bitcoin Script and how it operates within the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin Script is a simple stack-based programming language used to implement smart contracts on the Bitcoin network. It is not Turing complete, meaning that it does not have the ability to solve all computational problems, but it is powerful enough to implement a wide range of smart contracts. In this lab, we will implement a simple Bitcoin Script interpreter and use it to execute a few simple scripts. The lab consists of three parts. Each part will be explained in more detail in their own sections.
## 3.  Lab 3: Solidity smart contracts
Solidity is a versatile programming language used for creating smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. Smart contracts are self-executing programs that automatically enforce predefined
rules and agreements, enabling trustless and automated transactions. In this lab assignment, we will explore the fundamentals of Solidity and Ethereum and then choose one of several interesting problems to solve by developing a Solidity smart contract.
